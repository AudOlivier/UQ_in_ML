Readme file for Abaqus Scripts

This folder contains some scripts used to pre/post-process data from the Abaqus FE problem (tensile test on a composite microstructure):

- Quantify_aleatoric_v3_bis.ipynb contains functions to evaluate the amount of aleatoric uncertainty in the data, and does some plots for the manuscript,
- utility_functions.py contains a bunch of utility functions called from all the notebooks that handle this materials data,
- data_aleatoric_n[10/20]_bis_a[400].pkl contains the data used to evaluate the aleatoric uncertainty (i.e., from runs where the material properties were fixed and the position of fibers was randomly sampled),
- IOfolder_few_runs contains some raw data generated by MARCC, used for certain plots.
- Preprocess_data.ipynb reads the high dimensional data generated on MARCC (pkl files such as the ones in IOfolder_few_runs) and saves only the input / output matrices needed for network training (training_beta_bis_a[400].pkl and so on). Note that all the raw data is not saved here.

** Folder MARCC_scripts **

The folder MARCC_scripts contains scripts that can be run on MARCC to run the Abaqus FEM problem:

- RunModels_v3_forUQ.py is the main file, it reads data (material properties) from a couple of csv files, then create the Abaqus model and runs it, then save the necessary outputs (stresses, strains, averaged values...) to pkl files for easier post-processing.
- abaqusModel_functions_v3_forUQ.py contains Abaqus scripting functions called by RunModels_v3_forUQ.py, necessary to create the model, run the job and extract outputs from the odb file created by Abaqus.
- Script_Abaqus_v3.sh is the bash script to call on MARCC. As is, it assumes all the necessary files are in a folder /home-1/aolivie1@jhu.edu/scratch/AbaqusModel_v3/. It runs an array of jobs (different material properties).

- CreateInputData_v3.py samples the random material properties for the various materials. It saves the properties to a couple of csv files, that will be read later by the RunModels_v3_forUQ.py file.
- Script_Generate_Data.sh is the bash file called on MARCC to run CreateInputData_v3.py and generate the csv files.

- utils_v3.py contains a bunch of utility functions.
